	definition, in a bivariate time-series context. It is argued that
	a sound and natural approach to such tests must rely primarily on
	the out-of-sample forecasting performance of models relating the
	original (non-prewhitened) series of interest. A specific technique
	of this sort is presented and employed to investigate the relation
	between aggregate advertising and aggregate consumption spending.
	The null hypothesis that advertising does not cause consumption
	cannot be rejected, but some evidence suggesting that consumption
	may cause advertising is presented.},

  month = jun,
  note = {Let F be a (nonempty) set of distribution functions (d.f.'s) of random
	variables (r.v.'s) with zero means and positive, finite variances.
	Let F(F) be the set of all sequences of independent r.v.'s (independent
	within each sequence) whose d.f.'s belong to F but are not necessarily
	the same from term to term of the sequence. No assumptions are made
	on the interrelations between the joint probability spaces of the
	r.v.'s of different sequences of F(F). Accordingly, dependence or
	independence between r.v.'s of different sequences needs not be
	specified. A generic member of F(F) will be denoted by Îµ = {Îµk;
	k = 1, 2, â‹¯}, or, when we discuss sequences of members of F(F),
	by Îµ(n) = {Îµnk; k = 1, 2, â‹¯}, n = 1, 2, â‹¯. In the following,
	F(F) plays the role of a parameter space, the parameter points being
	Îµ, Îµ(1), Îµ(2), â‹¯. Since only the d.f.'s of a sequence of (independent)
	r.v.'s are relevant to the central limit theorem, instead of F(F),
	the set of sequences of d.f.'s corresponding to the elements of
	F(F) may also be regarded as the parameter space. It clearly is
	a map of F(F). The inverse mapping subdivides F(F) into certain
	equivalence classes. From elementary set theory it follows that
	F(F) as well as its map has the cardinality of the continuum if
	F contains more than one element. Further, let {ank; n = 1, 2, â‹¯;
	k = 1, 2, â‹¯} be a double sequence of real constants, and let {kn}
	be a sequence of positive integers such that ankn â‰  0 and ank
	= 0 for \$k {\textgreater} k\_n, n = 1, 2, {\textbackslash}cdots\$
	. We denote the variance of âˆ‘kn k=1 ankÎµnk by {\textbackslash}begin{equation*}{\textbackslash}tag{1}B\_n{\textasciicircum}2
	= {\textbackslash}sum{\textasciicircum}{k\_n}\_{k=1} a{\textasciicircum}2\_{nk}{\textbackslash}sigma{\textasciicircum}2\_{nk},
	{\textbackslash}quad{\textbackslash}sigma{\textasciicircum}2\_{nk}
	= {\textbackslash}operatorname{var} {\textbackslash}epsilon\_{nk},{\textbackslash}end{equation*}
	and put {\textbackslash}begin{equation*}{\textbackslash}tag{2}{\textbackslash}zeta\_n
	= B\_n{\textasciicircum}{-1} {\textbackslash}sum{\textasciicircum}{k\_n}\_{k=1}
	a\_{nk}{\textbackslash}epsilon\_{nk},{\textbackslash}quad n = 1,
	2, {\textbackslash}cdots,{\textbackslash}end{equation*} where Bn
	= + (Bn 2)1/2. If all sequences Îµ(n) are identical we denote them
	by Îµ and write instead of (2) \${\textbackslash}zeta\_n({\textbackslash}epsilon)
	= B\_n{\textasciicircum}{-1}({\textbackslash}epsilon) {\textbackslash}sum{\textasciicircum}{k\_n}\_{k=1}
	a\_{nk}{\textbackslash}epsilon\_k, {\textbackslash}quad n = 1, 2,
	{\textbackslash}cdots,\$ which shows the dependence on the parameter
	Îµ more clearly; Bn 2(Îµ) is defined analogously to (1). This note
	deals with necessary and sufficient conditions on the set F and
	on the double sequence {ank} in order that the d.f.'s of the Î¶n
	tend to the standard normal d.f. (denoted by Î¦(x)) and that the
	B-1 na nkÎµnk are infinitesimal for every sequence of sequences
	Îµ(1), Îµ(2), â‹¯ Îµ F(F) (Theorem 1). For the case of identical
	sequences Îµ(n) (= Îµ), which is of particular interest in applications,
	a normal convergence theorem (Theorem 3) holding uniformly for Îµ
	on F(F) is obtained under the same necessary and sufficient conditions
	as in Theorem 1. Theorem 3 yields, e.g., conditions for the asymptotic
	normality of the least squares estimators of the parameters in a
	linear regression with independent and not necessarily identically
	distributed errors whose d.f.'s are unknown but belong to a certain
	class F (Eicker (1963)). From the necessity of the conditions it
	follows that these conditions are the best possible ones under the
	limited information about the error terms provided by the model
	assumptions. Frequently, when limit theorems for families of sequences
	of random variables are met in statistics and probability theory,
	the emphasis is on the uniformity of the convergence of the sequences
	with respect to the family parameter which assumes values in a given
	a priori set. (For an example, compare Parzen (1954), p. 38. That
	paper also cites some of the earlier publications on the subject.)
	The present note emphasizes not primarily the uniformity of the
	convergence, but the necessity of the conditions (including one
	on the parameter space F(F)) for the convergence on the parameter
	space. Accordingly, the set F cannot be prescribed arbitrarily.
	The uniformity of the convergence on F(F) is shown without difficulty
	to be implied by the ordinary convergence on F(F). Another difference
	from earlier work may be seen in the particular structure of F(F),
	which is comparable to an infinite-dimensional vector space. Although
	many of the earlier convergence theorems are (or can be) formulated
	for abstract parameter spaces, in the applications such as estimation
	theory these spaces are usually specialized to intervals on the
	line or in a finite-dimensional vector space.},

  abstract = {Asymptotic theory typically presumes that the dimensionality of econometric
	models is independent of the sample size even though this presumption
	is often quite unrealistic. In GMM estimation, whenever optimal
	instruments are not available, it can frequently be shown that adding
	over-identifying restrictions (moment conditions) will increase
	asymptotic precision. However, the conventional asymptotics which
	underlies this view insists that the number of moment conditions
	remain finite even though the number of available moment conditions
	may grow without bound. We consider the explicit dependence of the
	number of moment conditions (or instruments), qn, on the sample
	size, n, and establish that, under conventional regularity conditions
	for the estimation of a linear model with general heteroskedasticity,
	qn3/n--{\textgreater}0 is a sufficient condition for the validity
	of conventional asymptotic inference about the GMM estimator.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the role of fluctuations in the aggregate consumption-wealth
	ratio for predicting stock returns. Using U.S. quarterly stock market
	data, we find that these fluctuations in the consumption-wealth
	ratio are strong predictors of both real stock returns and excess
	returns over a Treasury bill rate. We also find that this variable
	is a better forecaster of future returns at short and intermediate
	horizons than is the dividend yield, the dividend payout ratio,
	and several other popular forecasting variables. Why should the
	consumption-wealth ratio forecast asset returns? We show that a
	wide class of optimal models of consumer behavior imply that the
	log consumption-aggregate wealth (human capital plus asset holdings)
	ratio summarizes expected returns on aggregate wealth, or the market
	portfolio. Although this ratio is not observable, we provide assumptions
	under which its important predictive components for future asset
	returns may be xpressed in terms of observable variables, namely
	in terms of consumption, asset holdings and labor income. The framework
	implies that these variables are cointegrated, and that deviations
	from this shared trend summarize agents' expectations of future
	returns on the market portfolio.},
